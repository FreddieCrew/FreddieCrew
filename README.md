# About Me

## Favorite Movie
Pcking a favorite movie is tough because I'm into so many, but if I had to choose, it's probably either "Forrest Gump" or "Full Metal Jacket", both are just awesome '90s flicks.


## Favorite Music Genres
Definitely rap and rock.

## Favorite Song
It's a real toss-up, but I'd say "Simple Man" or "Free Bird" by Lynyrd Skynyrd are my go-tos.

## First Language
Can't really pinpoint my first language, but I think it was GTA3Script when I was just a kid messing around. Didn't know squat back then. The language that really got me into programming though was Pawn. So, yeah, Pawn was my start.

## Tech Stack
Day-to-day, I'm mainly rolling with JS/TS, Pawn, and sometimes messing around with C and C++.
