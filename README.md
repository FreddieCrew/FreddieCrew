# About Me

## Your favorite movies
Picking a favorite movie is mighty hard for me cause I'm into so many but if I had to choose, it's either "Forrest Gump" or "Full Metal Jacket" both are awesome 90s/late 80s flicks

## Your favorite music genres
Definitely rap and rock.

## Your favorite song
Probably "Whiskey-Rock-a-Roller" by Skynyrd

## Your first programming language
I can't really pinpoint my first language, but I think it was GTA3SCRIPT back when I was a kid fucking around, didn't know squat back then, but the language that really gotten me into programming though was Pawn.

## Techstack
JS/TS and Pawn, and sometimes fucking around with C and C++.

## Languages
English and Spanish are my main languages. I also speak a tiny little bit of French.
